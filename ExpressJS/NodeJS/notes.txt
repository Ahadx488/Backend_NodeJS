# What is Express.js

Express.js is a lightweight and flexible web framework built on top of Node.js. While Node.js provides low-level APIs to create servers, Express.js simplifies backend development by offering easy routing, middleware support, and request–response handling. It is mainly used to build web servers, RESTful APIs, and backend applications in a faster and more organized way.

# Why Express.js is used

Node.js alone requires writing a lot of boilerplate code for handling routes, headers, and responses. Express.js reduces this complexity by providing a clean and minimal interface. It acts as a layer between the client and Node.js, making server-side logic easier to write, read, and maintain.

# Pros of Express.js

Express.js is fast, lightweight, and easy to learn, which makes it ideal for beginners as well as production use. It is highly flexible and does not force a strict project structure, allowing developers to design applications their own way. Express has a huge ecosystem of middleware available through npm, making tasks like authentication, logging, and validation simple. It works very well for building REST APIs and integrates smoothly with databases like MongoDB and MySQL.

# Cons of Express.js

Express.js does not provide a predefined architecture, which can lead to messy code in large projects if not structured properly. Error handling and security features are mostly manual, requiring extra care from developers. For very large and complex enterprise applications, Express alone may feel insufficient and frameworks like NestJS are often preferred.

# When to use Express.js

Express.js is best suited for backend development of web applications, REST APIs, and microservices. It is widely used for learning backend development and for small to medium-scale production applications where speed and flexibility are important.

====================

Core features of Express.js :-
    Routing (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
    Middleware support
    REST API creation
    Fast & minimal
    Built on event-driven, non-blocking I/O

Why Express.js is used
    Node.js alone is low-level
    Express provides:
        routing
        middleware
        easier request/response handling

👉 Express sits between client and Node.js, handling requests and responses.
