What is npm?

npm stands for Node Package Manager. It’s the default tool used with Node.js to:

📦 Install libraries (packages)

🧰 Manage project dependencies

▶️ Run scripts (like starting servers or building apps)

==========================

## The 3 main parts of npm

1️⃣ npm Registry

=> A huge online database with millions of JavaScript packages

Examples:
    react – UI library
    express – backend framework
    lodash – utility helpers

Anyone can publish packages, and anyone can use them.

2️⃣ npm CLI (the command-line tool)

This is what you actually type in the terminal.
It downloads packages, updates files, and runs scripts.

3️⃣ package.json (the brain of your project 🧠)

    Every npm project has a package.json file. It tells npm:

        ->Project name & version
        ->Which packages you depend on
        ->Scripts you can run

Why npm matters
    ->Without npm, you’d have to:
    ->Manually download libraries
    ->Track versions by hand
    ->Share dependencies manually

    npm makes JavaScript development scalable and sane.

========= IMP ========

npm dependencies are divided into two types:

dependencies: Packages required for the application to run in production (e.g., frameworks and runtime libraries).

devDependencies: Packages needed only during development, such as testing tools, linters, and build tools.

Using npm simplifies JavaScript development by handling dependency management, version control, and project consistency across different environments.
