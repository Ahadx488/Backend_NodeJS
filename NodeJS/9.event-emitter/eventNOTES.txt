The Node.js Event emitter

If you worked with JavaScript in the browser, you know how much of the interaction of the user is handled through events: mouse clicks, keyboard button presses, reacting to mouse movements,and so on.

On the backend side, Node.js offers us the option to build a similar system using the events module.
This module, in particular, offers the EventEmitter class, which we'll use to handle our events.

########

An Event Emitter is a mechanism that allows objects to emit (fire) events and other parts of the code to listen and respond to those events.

==> used mostly in node.js not in browser js

#emit() → fires the event
#on() → listens to the event



❌ No. Event Emitters are NOT like threads.

Correct conclusion (1 line):

Event Emitters are a communication mechanism, not parallel execution like threads.

Why (super short):

Threads → run code in parallel

Event Emitters → signal events and run listeners one by one on the same single thread
